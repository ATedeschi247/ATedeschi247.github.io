        <h1>2022 New Year's Resolutions</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="text-center">As we all know, the coming of the new year is a time for us to reflect on
      what we've done in the past year and how we will improve ourselves this year.</p>
      <p class="text-center">That is why I am going to share with you my new year's resolutions for 2022!</p>
      <br>
      <canvas class="codehs-editor-canvas" height="400px" width="500px"></canvas>
      <br><br>
      <p>My resolutions for this year are to:</p>
      <ul class="li-effect">
        <li>Continue to exercise and keep physically fit.</li>
        <li>Slow down on the sugars and sweets (in other words, not to have too much of them).</li>
        <li>To continue to do well in my classes and all of the other responsibilities that I have.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I chose to set these goals for myself because recently I have been slacking off
      a bit in my exercises and in my dieting. Going into this new year, I want to
      make sure that I will stay healthy and fit, and setting these goals for myself would
      be a way for me to do that with a better chance of success.</p>
      <p>That is the specific reason for the first two goals, but the reason for my last goal
      speaks for itself. I'm doing well in school right now, and I want to be sure that
      I can continue to do so going forward. This applies to the rest of this school year
      and the entirety of next school year as well.</p>
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Methods of Completion</h1>
      </div>
      <p>It would be beneficial for me to outline a general plan for how to complete these goals
      throughout the year. That is why I will lay out subtasks that I can work towards for each
      quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>From January to March I can:</p>
      <ul class="li-effect">
        <li>Train to be able to do 35 push-ups in one minute (so that I may be able to do it by the end of March).</li>
        <li>Set a limit for myself on the number of times that I can eat outside of meals. To start it
        off for this quarter, I can limit myself to 5 snacks per week.</li>
        <li>Commit myself to studying for 1-2 hours for each test that I will take in school (in order to maintain my grades).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>From April to June I can:</p>
      <ul class="li-effect">
        <li>Train to increase the amount of push-ups that I can do from 35 in a minute to 40 in a minute.</li>
        <li>Decrease the amount of times I can snack to 4 times per week (in an effort to ease myself into snacking less).</li>
        <li>Continue to study for 1-2 hours of my own time for each test that I have.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>From July to September I can:</p>
      <ul class="li-effect">
        <li>Train myself to increase my push-ups per minute by another 5 (going from 40 to 45).</li>
        <li>Reduce the number of times that I can snack per week from 4 times per week to 3 times.</li>
        <li>Start off the new school year strong in September. It is important to do this after
        summer because I must account for the "summer slide" that I just went through so that
        it will not hinder my academic progress in the new school year.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Finally, from October to December I can:</p>
      <ul class="li-effect">
        <li>Train to make the final increase in my push-ups per minute, where I will strive
        to go from doing 45 push-ups in one minute to my final goal of 50 push-ups!</li>
        <li>Reduce the number of snacks that I can eat outside of meals from 3 snacks per week
        to 2! This will surely help in keeping healthy!</li>
        <li>Ramp up my study times from September back up to 2 hours per test. This will ensure
        that I am well-prepared for just about any test that I may have to take, which will certainly
        boost my grade and make it good.</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>I know it might feel very chummy and cliche to talk about improving ourselves with each
            coming year, but that is exactly what each of us needs to do every day. Even if we are just incrementally
            striving to get closer and closer to our yearly goals, like I was just planning to do, that would
            still help a lot! We could all make small goals for ourselves every so often that, when combined
            together, could add up to something positive.</p>
